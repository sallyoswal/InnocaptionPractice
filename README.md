# E-Commerce Platform

This project is a React-based web application for an e-commerce platform, designed to interact with a product database via the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/docs). It provides a seamless shopping experience, allowing customers to view products, manage their shopping cart, and search for products by name or category.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Customers can view a list of available products for purchase.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add items to their cart, edit quantities, or remove items. While the dummy API does not persist changes, the application simulates these functionalities locally.
- **Product Search**: A search feature enables users to find products by their names or categories.
